I’m a big fan of the BBC show [University Challenge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t6l0). Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to have much of an online fanbase. For example, [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityChallengeUK/top/?sort=top&t=month) is completely inactive (but I did find a Tumblr called [Cuties of University Challenge](https://cutiesofuniversitychallenge.tumblr.com/)). [Sean Blanchflower](http://www.blanchflower.org/uc/ucstat.html) even keeps track of overall season statistics, but that’s about as involved as anyone seems to be.

So, I’ve started a [University Challenge Questions Database](/assets/uchallenge/uc.html).

I’ve been parsing subtitles from the show using Python and PHP ([code here](https://github.com/nequals30/universityChallenge)), and now I’ve gotten it to sort questions and answers.

In the future, I hope to add team statistics, and sort questions by subject.
